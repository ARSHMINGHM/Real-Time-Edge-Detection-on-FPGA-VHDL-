# Real-Time-Edge-Detection-on-FPGA-VHDL-
- Developed a real-time image processing system for edge detection using VHDL on FPGA   - Grouped pixels into 2Ã—2 blocks to detect brightness changes with minimal noise   - Prototyped in Python/C, synthesized with Vivado HLS, and validated using testbenches
